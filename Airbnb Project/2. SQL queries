# 1. Checking for errors
SELECT * FROM `airbnb-data-cleaning.London_data.Listings` LIMIT 1000

## 2. By performing a join operation between the Listings and Reviews tables, I resolved import errors in the 'last review date' field. This allowed me to accurately populate the table with the correct dates and cross-reference them against the original data
SELECT 
    listings.*,
    MAX(reviews.date) AS latest_reviews_date 
FROM 
    `airbnb-data-cleaning.London_data.Listings` AS listings
JOIN 
    `airbnb-data-cleaning.London_data.Reviews` AS reviews
ON 
    reviews.listing_id = listings.id
GROUP BY 
    listings.id, 
    listings.name, 
    listings.host_id, 
    listings.host_name, 
    listings.neighbourhood_group, 
    listings.neighbourhood, 
    listings.latitude, 
    listings.longitude, 
    listings.room_type,  
    listings.price, 
    listings.minimum_nights, 
    listings.number_of_reviews,  
    listings.last_review, 
    listings.reviews_per_month,  
    listings.calculated_host_listings_count, 
    listings.availability_365, 
    listings.number_of_reviews_ltm, 
    listings.license


## 3. Condensed values in the 'name' column of the Listings table were split apart for clearer analysis, allowing each value to have its own dedicated column.
SELECT 
    name,
    SPLIT(name, ' · ')[SAFE_OFFSET(0)] AS property_type,
    SPLIT(name, ' · ')[SAFE_OFFSET(1)] AS rating, -- Number extracted at a later stage due to multiple value types
    CAST(REGEXP_EXTRACT(COALESCE(SPLIT(name, ' · ')[SAFE_OFFSET(2)], ''), r'(\d+)') AS INT64) AS bedrooms,
    CAST(REGEXP_EXTRACT(COALESCE(SPLIT(name, ' · ')[SAFE_OFFSET(3)], ''), r'(\d+)') AS INT64) AS beds,
    SPLIT(COALESCE(SPLIT(name, ' · ')[SAFE_OFFSET(4)], ''), ' ')[OFFSET(0)] AS bath,-- Number extracted at a later stage due to multiple value types
    id, 
    host_id, 
    host_name, 
    neighbourhood, 
    latitude, 
    longitude, 
    room_type, 
    price, 
    minimum_nights, 
    number_of_reviews, 
    last_review, 
    reviews_per_month, 
    calculated_host_listings_count, 
    availability_365, 
    number_of_reviews_ltm
FROM 
    `airbnb-data-cleaning.London_data.populated_listings`

## 4. Combining the 2nd and 3rd query using a combination of subqueries and join functions 
SELECT 
    SPLIT(subquery.name, ' · ')[SAFE_OFFSET(0)] AS property_type,
    SPLIT(subquery.name, ' · ')[SAFE_OFFSET(1)] AS rating,
    CAST(REGEXP_EXTRACT(COALESCE(SPLIT(subquery.name, ' · ')[SAFE_OFFSET(2)], ''), r'(\d+)') AS INT64) AS bedrooms,
    CAST(REGEXP_EXTRACT(COALESCE(SPLIT(subquery.name, ' · ')[SAFE_OFFSET(3)], ''), r'(\d+)') AS INT64) AS beds,
    CAST(REGEXP_EXTRACT(COALESCE(SPLIT(subquery.name, ' · ')[SAFE_OFFSET(4)], ''), r'(\d+)') AS INT64) AS baths,
    subquery.id, 
    subquery.host_id, 
    subquery.host_name, 
    subquery.neighbourhood, 
    subquery.latitude, 
    subquery.longitude,

    subquery.reviews_per_month, 
    subquery.calculated_host_listings_count, 
    subquery.availability_365, 
    subquery.number_of_reviews_ltm,
    subquery.license
FROM (
    SELECT 
        listings.*,
        MAX(reviews.date) as latest_reviews_date 
    FROM `airbnb-data-cleaning.London_data.Listings` as listings
    JOIN `airbnb-data-cleaning.London_data.Reviews` as reviews
    ON reviews.listing_id = listings.id
    GROUP by 
        listings.id, 
        listings.name, 
        listings.host_id, 
        listings.host_name, 
        listings.neighbourhood_group, 
        listings.neighbourhood, 
        listings.latitude, 
        listings.longitude, 
        listings.room_type,  
        listings.price, 
        listings.minimum_nights,

        listings.number_of_reviews_ltm,
        listings.license
) AS subquery;

## Exporting the query results from the previous query 4. into a new table resolved issues stemming from aggregate function.

SELECT * FROM `airbnb-data-cleaning.London_data.Cleaned_data`

## When attempting to format the ratings so that it reads just the numeric value as a FLOAT without the string I came across an error due to some data from the bedrooms column being mixed into the ratings column

SELECT rating, bedrooms, beds, baths
FROM `airbnb-data-cleaning.London_data.Cleaned_data`
WHERE rating LIKE '%bedrooms%'

## To update this I updated query 4. so that the ratings column would only be populated when theres a ★ before it
SELECT 
    SPLIT(subquery.name, ' · ')[SAFE_OFFSET(0)] AS property_type,
    CASE 
        WHEN REGEXP_CONTAINS(SPLIT(subquery.name, ' · ')[SAFE_OFFSET(1)], r'^★') THEN SPLIT(subquery.name, ' · ')[SAFE_OFFSET(1)]
        ELSE NULL
    END AS rating,
    CAST(REGEXP_EXTRACT(COALESCE(SPLIT(subquery.name, ' · ')[SAFE_OFFSET(2)], ''), r'(\d+)') AS INT64) AS bedrooms,
    CAST(REGEXP_EXTRACT(COALESCE(SPLIT(subquery.name, ' · ')[SAFE_OFFSET(3)], ''), r'(\d+)') AS INT64) AS beds,
    CAST(REGEXP_EXTRACT(COALESCE(SPLIT(subquery.name, ' · ')[SAFE_OFFSET(4)], ''), r'(\d+)') AS INT64) AS baths,
    subquery.id, 
    subquery.host_id, 
    subquery.host_name, 
    subquery.neighbourhood, 
    subquery.latitude, 
    subquery.longitude, 
    subquery.room_type, 
    subquery.price, 
    subquery.minimum_nights, 
    subquery.number_of_reviews, 
    subquery.last_review, 
    subquery.reviews_per_month, 
    subquery.calculated_host_listings_count, 
    subquery.availability_365, 
    subquery.number_of_reviews_ltm,
    subquery.license
FROM (
    SELECT 
        listings.*,
        MAX(reviews.date) as latest_reviews_date 
    FROM `airbnb-data-cleaning.London_data.Listings` as listings
    JOIN `airbnb-data-cleaning.London_data.Reviews` as reviews
    ON reviews.listing_id = listings.id
    GROUP by 
        listings.id,

        listings.availability_365, 
        listings.number_of_reviews_ltm,

) AS subquery;

## We can now export the results as a new table and check if there are still errors in splitting the name column

SELECT rating
FROM `airbnb-data-cleaning.London_data.Cleaned_data_2`
WHERE rating LIKE '%New%'

## Again when formatting the rating column as FLOAT instead of string an error came up for some values coming up as '★New' since this can be accounted for due to being new listings we can null these values

SELECT
    property_type,
    CASE 
        WHEN rating LIKE '%New%' THEN NULL
        ELSE CAST(REPLACE(rating, '★', '') AS FLOAT64)
    END AS Rating,
