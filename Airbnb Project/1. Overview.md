## Airbnb Data Cleaning And Data Visualisation

For this project, I used [Inside Airbnb Data](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data).

### Project Focus:

### Data Cleaning with SQL (BigQuery):

**Data Accuracy:** The primary emphasis was on ensuring the accuracy of the dataset by addressing inconsistencies, inaccuracies, and missing or incorrect values. This involved meticulous examination and rectification of data anomalies.

**Consistency Enhancement:** Standardizing formats, correcting data types, and unifying representations across various attributes. Consistent data ensures reliability and compatibility across analyses.

**Reliability Enhancement:** Focusing on data quality improvements to enhance the dataset's reliability. This included error handling, outlier identification, and addressing anomalies that might affect the trustworthiness of the dataset.

### Visualization with R:

**Data Manipulation:** After cleansing in SQL, the refined dataset was used to summarise, aggregate and visualise findings.

**Insightful Visual Representations:** Utilised R's visualisation libraries (e.g., ggplot2) to create compelling and informative visual representations. This facilitated the exploration of key trends, patterns, and insights within the dataset.
