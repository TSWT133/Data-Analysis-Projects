The most notable observation when comparing the visualisations above shows that even though the private room makes up for ~40% of listings, it accounts for 56% of the total reviews. This disparity could suggest a higher level of satisfaction from guests through the level of service they receive, or even by an overrepresentation of reviews received from more vocal/engaged guests. Causal analysis is an option to test the thesis, however, strict conditions need to be met for a valid analysis.
