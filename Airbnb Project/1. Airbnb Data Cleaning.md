## Airbnb Data Cleaning And Data Visulisation

For this project, I worked with the [Inside Airbnb Data](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data). The primary objective was to execute a data cleaning process using SQL (specifically BigQuery) to ensure the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of the dataset, and then visualisationss through R

### Project Focus:

- **Data Cleansing:** Employing SQL via BigQuery to systematically clean and prepare the Airbnb Open Data. This involved addressing missing values, standardizing formats, rectifying inconsistencies, and enhancing data quality.

### Dataset Source:

The project exclusively revolves around the comprehensive [Inside Airbnb Data](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data). This dataset encapsulates a wide array of information related to Airbnb listings, including geographical locations, property details, prices, and more.
